This is just a simple application that show some cat picture everytime.
we use this as a simple app to learn something in js/css/html
if you want to practice more in javascript and css, you can complete below tasks:

**setup the functionality of whole setting box:**
1- blur rate should work as the api can send blured pictures.
2- grayscale should work as the api have an option for grayscale or normal filter on pictures.
3- "Set Size" should toggle the enable and desable on "Width" and "Height" box.
4- by passing numbers to "Width" and "Height" you have to get picture on same size as api have an option for that.
5- get the values for number of images to load and number of images to load each time on this "Setting" box.
6- redesign app and use better colors for background.
